voluntary framework w 3 primary components to manage cybersecurity risk:
- CSF Core
	- describes cybersec outcomes that can by used by any org size
	- focuses on reducing org's cybersec risks
	- 6 functions repping diff pts in security risk mgmt lifecycle that helps enhance cybersec protection... pne sing: governID, protect, detect, respond, recover
		- govern
			- oversight needed for other 5
		- identify (ID)
			- understand A's n suppliers of org
			- cybersec risks related to A n suppliers
			- ID improvement oppro related to org's
				- cybersec risk mgmt policies
				- plans
				- processes
				- procedures
				- practices
		- protect (PR)
			- org's ability to secure A to prevent/reduce likelihood/impact of adverse cybersec events
			- safeguards incl
				- id mgmt, authentication, access control
				- awareness, training
				- data security
				- platform security
				- infrastructure security
		- detect (DE)
			- timely discovery of cybersecurity attacks/incidents by analyzing
				- anomalies
				- indicators of compromise
				- other potentially adverse events that may indicate attack/incident 
		- respond (RS)
			- ability to contain effects of cybersec incidents
			- outcomes cover
				- incident mgmt
				- analysis
				- mitigation
				- reporting
				- comms
		- recover (RC)
			- supporting restoration of normal op to reduce incident impact
			- comms recovery efforts effectively/appropriately

- CSF Tiers
	- inform org of effectiveness of csf org prof
	- measure of orgs info sec infrastructure sophistication 
		- dont serve as means to implement 6 functions
		- categorize degree to which info sec practices *integrated* thruout org
		- complement an orgs existing cybersec risk mgmt methodology
		- can be used as benchmark to comms its org wide approach to managing cybersec risks
	- 4 lvls, orgs select tier based on their risk lvl
		- 1 - partial
			- small business
			- ![[Pasted image 20260219155324.png]]
		- 2 - risk informed
			- ![[Pasted image 20260219155346.png]]
		- 3 - repeatable
			- ![[Pasted image 20260219155407.png]]
		- 4 - adaptive
			- ![[Pasted image 20260219155445.png]]
	- div by 4 diff lvls, then subdivided into
		- cybersec risk governance
		- cybersec risk mgmt
- CSF Organizational Profiles
	- det success/failure of info sec implementation
	- mechanism by which NIST rec to measure cybersec risk n how to min risk
	- incl 1 or both
		- Current Profile - specifies outcome org achieving (or attempting) based on current cybersec posture
		- Target Profile - specifies desired outcome org has prioritized achieving, adn considers anticipated chngs to org's cybersec posture
	- Community Profile - baseline outcomes dev among many org due to shared interest/goal of industry/sector/topic/usecase
	- repeatable, 5 step approach to help inform cont improvement of org's cybersec posture... mne: some guy created AI
		- Scope Org Profile
		- Gather info needed to prep Org Profile
		- Create Org Profile
		- Analyze gaps bw Current n Target Profile, create action plan
		- Implement action plan, update Org Profile
