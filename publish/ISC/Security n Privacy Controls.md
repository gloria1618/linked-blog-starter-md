- set of security/privacy controls applicable to all info sys, now standard for federal info sec sys
- stricter compared to other two - designed for protecting info sys against sophisticated threats
	- other 2 for cost effectiveness, best practice implementation
- tho there is cost based approach to SP 800-53 implementation, org must carefully evaluate adopting framework bc can be burdensome given nearly 1,200 controls

- Purpose/Applicability
	- est controls for sys/orgs that can be implemented w/in sys/org that process, store, transmit data/info
	- standards designed to 
		- help orgs id sec/priv controls to manage risk, and
		- satisfy following sec/priv req
			- Office of Mgmt n Budget OMB Circular A-130
				- req controls for fed info sys
			- Fed Info Security Modernization Act FIMSA
				- req implementation of min controls to protect federal info n info sys
- Target Audience
	- sys admins
		- indiv w sys, info sec, priv, risk mgmt, oversight resp
		- authorizing officials, CIO, ISO, senior agency info and/or security officers
	- sys developers
		- program managers, sys engineers, hard/software devs, etc.
	- logistical personnel
		- procurement officials, sys integrators, prop managers
	- sec n priv personnel
		- sys sec/priv officers
	- sec n priv assessment n monitoring personnel
		- auditors, internal auditors, inspectors general, sys evaluators, control assessors, indep verifier/validators, analysts
	- commercial entities - 3rd party vendores
		- industry partners, component producers, security, priv/data backup/storage vendors
- Org Responsibilities
	- when managing sec/priv risks, following req by org
		- well defined sec n priv req for sys
		- use of trustworthy info sys components (ie hard/firm/software)
		- rigorous sec n priv planning n sys development life cycle mgmt
		- application of sys sec n priv practices for sys integration of info sys
		- comprehensive sec n priv practices documentation
		- continuous monitoring of info sys to eval ongoing effectiveness of controls
	- 3 control implementation approaches to be implemented on per control basis
		- Common (Inheritable) Control
			- implement at org lvl, adopted by info sys
		- Sys Specific Control
			- implement at info sys lvl
		- Hybrid
			- implement at org lvl where approp, rest at info sys lvl
