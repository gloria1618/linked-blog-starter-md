- gift - lack of consideration, no bargained for exchange
- Exception: donations
	- promise made to donate to charity that detrimentally and justifiably relies on promise is enforceable
- Past/Moral consideration
	- if smthn had alr been given/performed before promise made, it won't satisfy bargain req
	- ex: if u save drowning man and man wants to give reward, can't sue bc his promise didnt induce you to perform act
