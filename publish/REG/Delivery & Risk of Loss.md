- delivery n risk of loss can be independent of title
- as gen rule, sellers basic duty: (many contracts stray from this rule)
	- hold conforming goods for buyer
	- give buyer reasonable notice to enable buyer to take delivery
- UCC has specific rules for when/where deliver of goods is to be made
	- rules apply if contract silent
- risk of loss (who bears loss if goods destroyed) gen depends on time of delivery
	- if goods damaged/destroyed after risk of loss passed to buyer, buyer not discharged from contract, rather buyer must still pay contract price
- For Risk of Loss to Pass
	- step 1: ID goods
		- title n risk of loss cannot pass to buyer until goods are first identified
		- goods identified when
			- marked
			- segregated or
			- in some manner id as goods for specific buyer
	- step 2: parties must agree on contract terms
		- if parties designate when/where delivery will occur of risk of loss will pass, their agrmt governs
	- step 3: default rules apply in absence of agrmnt
		- code divides cases w no agrmnt on delivery/risk of loss into 2 categories
		- Noncarrier cases
			- default rule - seller has no duty to deliver/ship goods
			- buyer will usually pick up at sellers business place (or seller's residence if seller not merchant)
			- if seller not merchant, risk of loss passes to buyer upon seller's tender of delivery of goods to buyer (aka, says 'ready for pickup')
				- ![[Pasted image 20260108172743.png]]
			- merchant seller, risk of loss passes only upon actual delivery to buyer (ie buyer takes physical possession)
				- ![[Pasted image 20260108172757.png]]
		- Carrier cases
			- parties agree that common carrier will be used to ship goods to buyer
			- FOB - free on board, delivery term, always followed by location
			- if common carrier involv, contract either
				- shipment contract (FOB, seller's city)
					- risk of losses passes to buyer when goods delivered to carrier
					- if its boat, passes when goods placed nxt to boat bc cant get on boat
					- ![[Pasted image 20260108173836.png]]
				- destination contract (FOB, buyers city)
					- risk of losses passes to buyer when
						- goods reach destination
						- seller tenders delivery
			- Effect of Breach on Risk of Loss
				- if seller sends nonconforming goods (dont meet contract description), risk of loss remains on seller, regardless of shipping terms, unless buyer accepts defective goods
					- nonbreaching party (buyer) given all options (accept/reject)

		- 
- All sales final, unless otherwise agreed .... UCC provides 2 types of nonfinal sales
	- Sale on Approval
		- risk on seller until approval
		- buyer has right to return goods w/in x days
		- sale not final until buyer gives approval (ie sale w trial period)
		- title n risk of loss remain w seller until buyer approves
		- ![[Pasted image 20260108175059.png]]
	- Sale/Return Contracts
		- risk on buyer until returned 
		- sale/return is completed sale on delivery, but buyer has right to return goods (aka sale on consignment)
		- risk of loss passes to buyer when seller completes delivery req
		- risk remains w buyer until goods are completely returned 
		- lots of times w retailer, distributor
		- ![[Pasted image 20260108175129.png]]
- Title - ownership
	- title can pass at time/place parties agree on , but before title passes, goods must be identified to the contract
	- if no agrmnt when title passes, title passes when seller completes delivery req (if any)
		- time of delivery varies depending on delivery terms used (shipment/destination)
			- psst (noncarrier when tenders, carrier shipment when goods in truck, carrier destination when goods delivered)
	- if buyer rejects goods, whether right/wrongful rejection, title reverts to seller 
		- if it was nonconforming goods, risk of loss remains w seller but the buyer has title
