Methods of Formation & Sources of Contract Law
- Contract
	- agreement enforced by law
- Req elements of contract
	- offer & acceptance 
		- mutual asset
			- agreeing to 'same bargain at same time'
			- meeting of the minds
		- offer
			- express (oral/written) or implied (conduct)
			- stmt by offeror that gives recipient the power to form a contract by accepting before the offer is terminated
				- Termination of Offer
					- Revocation of offeror
						- gen rule: offeror can revoke an offer any time before acceptance by comms the revocation to offeree
						- true even if offeror promises to keep offer open
						- option contract
							- offeree pays to keep offer open, then irrevocable
							- distinct contract in which promisor promises to keep offer open in exchange for consideration from the promise
						- revocation can be direct/indirect, where the offeree receives correct info that offer no longer holds
							- express (oral/written)
							- implied (conduct/sell to someone else)
						- offers, rejections, counteroffers, revocations are gen effective when received by offeree
							- but where revocation is publication, it is effective when published
							- ^acceptances gen effective when sent/placed in mailbox?
							- 
					- Rejection of the offeree
						- once offer effectively rejected, it cannot be accepted
							- can reject expressly (oral/written)
						- counteroffer considered to be both
							- rejection of original
							- offer (where original offeror is now offeree)
						- inquiry is not rejection/counteroffer
						- if attempted acceptance is invalid for any reason, it becomes a counteroffer
							- u alr rejected it but then u say 'i accept', its at most a new offer
					- By operation of law
						- DIDI
						- Death
						- Incompetency
						- Destroyed
							- before accepted, oferee's power of acceptance terminated
						- Illegal
						- if either party dies/incompetent prior to acceptance, offer terminated
							- not necessary to comms death/incompetency to other party
						- exception: option contract not terminated by death
			- Intent to make a contract
				- offer sufficient enough for reasonable person to assume offer was serious offer to enter into contract
				- offeror's subj intent irrelevant
				- contract law gen follows obj theory (would reasonable person believe?)
				- stmts made in jest/frustration and understood by reasonable person are not offers
			- Ads
				- not offers bc not addressed to specific person
				- usually considered invitations seeking offers
				- exception: ads limiting scope of ppl who can accept considered offers
					- ex: reward $ for finding lost dog, drink for first 100 ppl at toms ... bc only way to accept is w conduct (performance)
			- Terms Must be Definite & Certain
				- essentials depends on contract type
				- offer for sale of goods gen need only incl qty term
					- UCC: gen only req qty term 
					- CL: must incl all terms (party, price, time, qty, type)
						- identity of offeree & subj matter
						- price to pay
						- time of performance
						- qty involved
						- type of work to perform
	- exchange of consideration (both sides get smthn, smthn of legal value)
	- no defenses to enforcement (fraud, duress, undue infl, mistake)
- Methods of Formation
	- Express Contract
		- formed by lang, oral, written
	- Implied in Fact Contract
		- contract formed by conduct
		- ex: bob tells doc he's sick, doc gives antibiotic, entered into contract for doc's services even tho no written/oral promises exchanged, conduct implies intent
		- ex: go up to register to pay
	- Implied in Law Contract/Quasi Contract
		- not a contract at all
		- remedy to prevent unjust enrichment of defendant
		- ex: I give 10k down pmt, contract oral, owner backs out, I can recover down pmt in quasi contract but cannot force sale of house
		- sale of land- writing req for contract to be enforceable
	- Unilateral Contract
		- accept w complete performance (conduct)
		- one promise, given in exchange for service
		- contract not formed until performance completed
		- ex: $ for lost dog
	- Bilateral Contract
		- accept w a promise
		- 2 promises, promise exchanged for a promise
		- contract formed as soon as promises exchanged 
		- ex: promise $100, if u promise to dye hair
