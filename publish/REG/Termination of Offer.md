- Revocation of offeror
	- gen rule: offeror can revoke an offer any time before acceptance by comms the revocation to offeree
	- true even if offeror promises to keep offer open
	- option contract
		- offeree pays to keep offer open, then irrevocable
		- distinct contract in which promisor promises to keep offer open in exchange for consideration from the promise
	- revocation can be direct/indirect, where the offeree receives correct info that offer no longer holds
		- express (oral/written)
		- implied (conduct/sell to someone else)
	- offers, rejections, counteroffers, revocations are gen effective when received by offeree
		- but where revocation is publication, it is effective when published
		- ^acceptances gen effective when sent/placed in mailbox?
		- 
- Rejection of the offeree
	- once offer effectively rejected, it cannot be accepted
		- can reject expressly (oral/written)
	- counteroffer considered to be both
		- rejection of original
		- offer (where original offeror is now offeree)
	- inquiry is not rejection/counteroffer
	- if attempted acceptance is invalid for any reason, it becomes a counteroffer
		- u alr rejected it but then u say 'i accept', its at most a new offer
- By operation of law
	- DIDI
	- Death
	- Incompetency
	- Destroyed
		- before accepted, oferee's power of acceptance terminated
	- Illegal
	- if either party dies/incompetent prior to acceptance, offer terminated
		- not necessary to comms death/incompetency to other party
	- exception: option contract not terminated by death
