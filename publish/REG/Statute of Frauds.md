altho gen contracts dont need to be in writing, 6 contracts req some type of writing to be enforceable
- both parties need not sign
- only party to be charged (defendant) must have signed

What Writing Suffices 
- 'contract' itself need not be in writing (can be informal)
	- req is some writing proving evidence of material terms of contract signed by person being sued
	- thus, letter about contract could suffice, even a letter seeking to revoke the contract
- contracts for sale of goods (UCC) gen need only have
	- qty term
	- defendant signature
- terms may be stated in 1+ docs
	- no req that all terms be stated in a single writing

Effect of Noncompliance
- failure to satisfy Statute of Frauds
	- doesnt prevent formation of contract, and
		- no issue if no one wants to back out, only courts req writing
	- makes contract unenforceable by one or both parties 
Exception [[UCC]]?
- exceptions to when writing not req to enforce contract incl
	- when alr been performed
	- admitted
	- involves sale of specially manufactured goods

6 contracts req writing
MYLEGS = marriage, yr, land, executors, goods, sretyship
- contracts where consideration is **Marriage**
- contracts which by terms cannot be performed w/in a **Year**
	- one yr period - date of contract, not when performance begins
		- ex: contract to wash car 2 yrs from now req writing
		- ex: contract to be agent for 3 yrs req writing
	- contract to work for life doesnt req writing, technically possible if empl dies soon
- contracts involv interests in **Land**/Lease
	- incl all contracts for sale of an interest in real prop, ex house/warehouse, and leases of real prop > yr
	- leases of land < yr dont req writing
- contracts by **Executors** or sim rep to pay estate debts out of personal funds
- contracts for sale of **Goods** for $500+
	- (services can be oral regardless of price so long as work can be done w/in year)
	- if sales contract modified, it is contract as it has been modified that det whether writing is req
	- [[CL]]
		- consideration must be paid in order to make modification enforceable
	- [[UCC]]
		- amt of contract as modified det whether writing req
		- consideration not req to make modification enforceable, req is good faith and voluntary agrmt
	- ![[Pasted image 20260107203045.png]]
