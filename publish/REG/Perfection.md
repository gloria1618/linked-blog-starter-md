- to acq max priority in collateral over other parties/creditors who may have interest in collateral, secured party must 'perfect'
- date of perfection cannot be before date of attachment
	- can occur at same time (eg taking possession of collateral)
	- date of perfection key for est priority among mult secured creditors

5 methods of perfection
- Filing
	- all types of collateral except deposit accts/money
	- debtor must give creditor express/implied authorization to file
	- docs to be filed (the financing stmt)
		- law req 'notice' filing 
			- does not req filing copy of security agrmt
		- 'notice' given by filing of a 'financing stmt'
		- financing stmt must give
			- names, addresses of credit/debtor
			- indication of collateral type covered by fin stmt (ex debtors inv n equip)
	- Timing
		- creditor can file fin stmt before all steps for attachment complete
		- so security interest not perfected until attaches to collateral
		- ** date of perfection cant be before attachment date, but filing early improves position in order of priority (first to file or perfect wins?)
- Taking possession of collateral
	- pledging 
	- if creditor takes possession, oral agrmt ok
	- similar to when pawn shop takes item in exchange for loan of $
	- in order to take possession, must be smthn tangible
	- prop owner can redeem pledged item by paying back amt borrowed
- Control
	- inv prop may be perfected by 'control'
		- possession of certificate
		- notice to broker
	- secured party (or other purchaser) has control of an item of inv prop when secured party has taken whatev steps needed to be able to have inv prop sold w/o further action from owner/debtor
	- if collateral is securities acct (few ppl actually phys possess stock/bonds the own), creditor will have control if owner/debtor instructs brokers/mutual fund company
		- that secured party now has whatever right in acct owner has, or
		- that broker/mutual fund company is to comply w secured party's orders w/o further consent of the owner/debtor

- Automatic perfection
	- Article 9 provides that security interest can be perfected by attachment of security interest w/o an other req
	- PMSI in consumer goods
	- arises where creditor either
		- sells collateral to debtor on credit n reserves a security interest, or
		- adv funds used to purchase the collateral n reserves security interest
		- *** item was not alr owned by debtor
	- PMSI also when bank lends $ and asks for security interest in item debtor purchases
	- historically only 2 types PMSI on exam
		- PMSI in consumer goods
			- only PMSI type that is auto perfected 
			- must be personal use
				- (PMSI in inv/equip collateral must be filed)
		- small scale assignment of accts
			- assignment of few AR
			- auto perfected
- Temporary perfection
	- lasts 20 days for proceeds
	- if creditor has perfected collateral n that collateral sold, creditor has temporary, perfected security interest in proceeds of collateral that was sold

	- Movement of debtor (4mo grace period)
		- if debtor moves from one state to another, perfection in first state gen valid for 4mo after debtor moves to 2nd state
		- to maintain its priority, creditor must perfect in new state w/in this 4mo period
