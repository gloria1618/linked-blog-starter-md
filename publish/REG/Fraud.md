MAIDS
can establish defense of fraud if they can prove:
- Misrepresentation of Material Fact by Defrauding Party
	- misrep must be of material fact
	- opinions/stmts of value do not count, unless made by experts
- Actual & Reasonable Reliance
	- unreasonable for buyer to rely on seller's biased opinion as to value
	- victim did actually, reasonably rely on misrep
		- bought car bc i thought it was brand new
- Intent to Induce Reliance
	- purpose of defrauding party in making misrep was to induce the victim to rely on misrep (to make sale)
	- why did they give false info?
- Damages
	- defrauder is liable to anyone who suffered loss
	- defrauded party may rescind contract or sue for $ damages, but not both
	- compensatory, punitive damages
- Scienter (Intent to Deceive)
	- misrep must be made w scienter
	- defrauder must make it knowingly, intentionally
	- defrauder gives info w reckless disregard for truth (constructive fraud or gross negligence)

Defense: Innocent Misrep
- MAID (no S)
- has all elements of fraud except scienter
- defrauder does not pay for punitive damages, only compensatory damages
- makes contract voidable by party who relied upon misrep
- *** both intentional/innocent misrep are defenses, difference is potential damages

2 Types of Fraud
- Fraud in Execution
	- party deceived into signing smthn that does not look like contract
		- ask celeb for signature but its contract lol
	- makes contract void, bc no meeting of minds
- Fraud in Inducement
	- defrauded party is aware of making contract, but terms are materially misrep
	- most fraud
	- voidable
