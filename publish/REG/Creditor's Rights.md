	- take possession by self-help w/o judicial process if she can do so w/o breach of peace
	- always take possession of collateral by replevy action
		- Judicial action seeking transfer of personal prop (Reduce Claim to Judgement >turn debt into judgment)

	- Sale wipes out all subordinate interests, such as:
		- interest of secured parties w lower priority
		- lien creditors, 
		- debtor's interest
- good faith purchaser of collateral at sale takes free of all subordinate interests but is subj to superior interests
	- man better find out who's foreclosing prop at auction jeez
- debtor has right to redeem by paying off the indebtedness n costs before sale, but this right is cut off by sale 

Proceeds
- proceeds of default sale dist in following order:
	- pay exp of repossession n sale
	- pay creditors w security interest in collateral in priority order
		- creditor w highest priority must be paid in full before any proceeds can go to next secured creditor 
	- surplus to debtor
- if sale of collateral doesn't bring enough $ to pay exp of sale n debt, secured party may bring court action to recover deficiency from debtor

Retention of Collateral in Satisfaction of Debt
- Transactions not involv consumers
	- after default, secured party may keep collateral in full/partial satisfaction of debt
- Transactions involv consumers (debtor is consumer)
	- w consumers, secured party may keep collateral only in full satisfaction of debt
- Notice must be given in full/partial satisfaction cases
	- in either case, secured party must give notice of intent to keep collateral to debtor and other secured parties
- Compulsory disposition of consumer goods (60% rule) - sale req
	- consumer goods cases where debtor has paid at least 60% of loan, secured party must sell collateral w/in 90dys after repossession, unless debtor waives right 
	- bc there's probs $ to return to debtor after selling
