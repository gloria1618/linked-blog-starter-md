- gen doesnt apply to mistakes of value, bc value gen considered opinion
	- parties find out before sale finalized fake watch, buyer can avoid
- if subj matter of contract is not in existence when contract made and neither party knows, contract is void
	- agree to buy car, but earlier car was raptured, void

- gen not a defense to contract
- must do due diligence before entering contract, ex: zoning
