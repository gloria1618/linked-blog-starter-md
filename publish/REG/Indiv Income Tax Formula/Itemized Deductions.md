		- 'tax benefit rule applies'
			- if txpyr itemizes deductions in yr and takes deductions for state income txes instead of a deduction for sales txes in yr, the tax benefit rule will:
				- calc taxability of state tax refund on extra benefit received from claiming higher state inc tax deduction instead of what would've been allowed if state sales tax had been deducted 
				- ex: paid 50k in state taxes, only 10k deductible, refund of 12k of 50k, well none of that benefitted so not taxed 
				- but if only paid 10k in taxes, and got 3k refund, then all of that taxable 
				- chat: If you deducted state income taxes instead of sales taxes and later get a refund, **only the portion of the refund that produced a tax benefit beyond what the sales tax deduction would have given you is taxable**.

	- Example (IMPORTANT)
		- # Why the cash (15k) and ordinary property (10k) reduce the LTCG limit
			-  Think of the 50% limit as a “total bucket”
				- Cash (60%) fills first
				- Ordinary income property (50%) fills next
				- LTCG property (30%) fills **last**
			- The **50% bucket can never be exceeded** by:
				- ordinary income property **plus**
				- LTCG property **plus**
				- any cash already deducted
			- So before deducting LTCG property, you must ask:
				-  “How much of my 50% AGI bucket is already used up?”
