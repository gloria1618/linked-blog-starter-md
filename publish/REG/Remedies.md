Damages
- most cases, awarded damages are gen $ (compensation)
- if $ damages inadequate (ie bc subj matter is unique), court can be asked for specific performance
- once there's breach, next step is to det damages to which non-breaching party is entitled
- numerous damage measures, but key is that intended to restore nonbreaching party as if no breach
- Compensatory Damages (Benefit of the Bargain)
	- standard damage measure for personal service contracts awards enough $ to obtain substitute performance

	- Consequential Damages if Foreseeable
		- additionally, party may collect damages that are reasonable foreseeable bc of breach
		- incidental costs (eg storage for barb, ad costs for buyer backing out)
		- unforeseeable damages not compensated
- Specific Performance (w Land or Unique Items)
	- alternative to $ damages, when $ doesn't fix
	- essentially court order that breaching party perform or face contempt charges
	- for interests in land or unique personal prop (unique real estate, artwork, antique car, etc.)
	- cannot be used to force party to perform personal service contracts
	- if specific performance available, injured party can choose to receive either specific performance or compensatory damages, but not both 
- Liquidated Damages (Damages Agreed to in the Contract)
	- clause in contract specifying what damages will be if breach
	- enforceable if amt is
		- reasonable in relation to actual harm done
		- not a penalty
			- bc for mere contract breach there's no punitive damages
	- even if damages agreed to in contract, court can decide if not enforceable
- Punitive Damages
	- usually not for breach of contract
		- more for like tort/wrongful act
	- available for [[Fraud]] (willful, malicious conduct), which is a tort cause of action
	- intended to punish defendant for acting in bad faith
- Recission or Cancellation
	- cancels contract and restores parties to former/original position
	- applied as remedy that can be granted if contract not alr substantially performed
	- for unilateral/mutual mistakes, fraud, most material contract breaches
	- doctrine of substantial performance
		- under [[CL]], party cant rescind/cancel if contract has been substantially performed 
		- in case of substantial performance and a minor breach, non breaching party's only remedy is monetary damages 
		- gen, substantial performance applies only if breaching party acts in good faith
			- if breaching party acted in bad faith, contract can be cancelled, and money damages awarded
- Limits on Monetary Damages
	- Foreseeability
		- consequential damages awarded only for those that at time the contract was formed a party could reasonably foresee would result from a breach
		- ex: garage building - car suffered extra weathering, extra storage costs for car
	- Mitigation (Reasonable Efforts to Avoid Damages)
		- under [[CL]], a nonbreaching party cannot recover damages that could have been reasonably avoided. party must mitigate damages
			- ex: prop leased 1 yr, tenanat moves out 3 mo in
				- landlord cant sue for breach of contract month after month w/o making effort to find new tenant
				- landlord must make good faith attempt
				- entitled to damages =# of months rent lost till finds new tenant
		- if injured by defective product, entitled to compensation for damages
		- cont use of defective product doesn't entitle you to additional damages
