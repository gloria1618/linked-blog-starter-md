Agency Coupled w an Interest
- if agency coupled w interest, principal doesnt have power or right to terminate agency
- only agent can terminate 
	- arises where agent has a security interest in prop of principal as creditor
	- if principal defaults, creditor automatically given power as agent and cannot be terminated by principal
- death, incapacity, bankruptcy of principal will not end agency coupled with an interest
